## INTRODUCTION
The Flight Fare Prediction Project represents a dynamic and innovative solution aimed at revolutionizing the way travellers plan and manage their flights. In an era where air travel has become an integral part of our lives, the ability to make informed decisions about flight fares is of paramount importance.

## PROJECT_PURPOSE
The primary goal of the Flight Fare Prediction Project is to bridge this information gap by harnessing the power of data science, machine learning, and modern web technologies. By doing so, it aims to provide travellers with valuable insights into future flight fares, enabling them to make more informed decisions about their travel plans. The project will leverage historical pricing data, real-time flight information, and advanced predictive algorithms to deliver accurate fare predictions to users.


## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
